            The Saints finished their season at 9-8, considerably underwhelming compared to the expectations of Dennis Allen's second year squad. After the signing of former Raiders' quarterback Derek Carr, the team had their eyes set on not only a playoff berth, but a divisional title as well. Come the end of the season, the team saw itself firing longtime offensive coordinator Pete Carmichael Jr., and discussion about both HC Dennis Allen and GM Mickey Loomis losing their jobs. How did they reach this point? It's quite simple: Despite having the second easiest SOS in the NFL, the Saints offense simply never put it together, although the talent was abundant.

            Carr signed a lucrative offseason deal, going up to 150 million dollars over 4 years. The QB was sought to elevate the play of those around him, and ease the pressure on the offensive line. However, the quarterback often found himself hitting the turf, and showing frustration while doing so. Carr's tendency of holding the ball too long while having a lack of pocket creativity, did not bode well for his image to the Saints' fanbase, either. What can be said, though, is the signal caller found himself settling into the offense and displaying chemistry with wide receivers Chris Olave and Rashid Shaheed the final 6 weeks, and with former Oregon UDFA Juwan Johnson the final three.

            New Orleans has no choice but to roll with Carr for at least the next 2 seasons as they restructured his deal, so for the team's and the coaches' sake, they need to hope he finds a way to maintain his level of play that was shown the final six weeks. He is likely to lose standout WR Michael Thomas in free agency, who seems all but gone after his recent series of tweets. However, the expected hiring of 49er's Passing Game Coordinator Klint Kubiak should ignite pre-snap motion and creativity the Saints desperately lacked ever since Sean Payton's departure. New Orleans is likely to take an OL in the early rounds of the draft as well, which help Derek Carr and the run game. This will be the most pivotal season for Carr, and the Saints in a long time.
